Let's go through a few questions together to check our understanding! 

## What is the probability of getting 3 of a kind in a 5 card poker hand?

First, let's take an overall view of what the question is really asking, which is to find:

$$P(\text{3 of a kind}) = \frac{\text{Number of ways to get 3 of a kind}}{\text{Total number of possible hands}}$$

The numerator is the more complex part, so we can start there. We want to know: how many ways can I get 3 of a kind. First, 1

## If you shuffle a standard deck of 52 plaing cards, what is the probability that the first 4 cards are aces, the next 4 are 1s, the next 4 2s and so on, until the last 4 cards are kings?

## If I flip 10 coins, what is the probability that exactly 7 are heads?
